            Flow control statements in Python are used to control the flow of
            execution in a program. They allow you to make decisions, create

            In Python, a list is a versatile and widely used data type that
            represents an ordered, mutable collection of elements. Lists can
            contain elements of different data types, and you can easily modify,
            add, or remove elements from a list. Lists are created using square

            In Python, a tuple is another sequence data type that is similar to
            a list. However, unlike lists, tuples are immutable, meaning their
            elements cannot be changed or modified after the tuple is created.
            Tuples are created using parentheses
            <span class="text-pink-600">( )</span> and can contain elements of

            package is essentially a directory that contains a special file
            called <span class="text-pink-600">__init__.py</span>, which can be
            empty or contain Python code. This file is executed when the package

          <p class="mt-3">
            Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that
            uses objects—collections of data and methods that operate on that
            data—to design and organize code. Python is an object-oriented
            programming language that supports the core principles of OOP.
            Here’s an introduction to OOP concepts in Python

          <p class="mt-3">
            In object-oriented programming (OOP), methods are functions that are
            associated with objects. They define the behavior of the objects and
            how they interact with each other. In Python, there are several
            types of methods, each serving a different purpose. Here are the
            main types of methods in Python

            Exception handling in Python allows you to handle runtime errors
            gracefully, preventing your program from crashing and providing a
            way to recover from unexpected situations. Python uses a try-except
            block to catch and handle exceptions. Here’s an overview of
            exception handling in Python.

          <p class="mt-3">
            Multithreading in Python allows you to execute multiple threads
            (smaller units of a process) concurrently, improving the performance
            of certain types of programs. However, due to the Global Interpreter
            Lock (GIL) in CPython, the benefits of multithreading for CPU-bound
            tasks are limited. Multithreading is more effective for I/O-bound
            tasks where threads can wait for I/O operations to complete.

          <h3 class="text-2xl text-blue-700">Python DB Programming</h3>
          <p class="mt-3">
            Python provides various libraries and modules for database
            programming, allowing you to interact with different database
            management systems (DBMS). Two commonly used modules are
            <span class="text-pink-600">sqlite3</span> (for SQLite databases)
            and <span class="text-pink-600">psycopg2</span> (for PostgreSQL
            databases). Here, I’ll provide a basic introduction to using
            <span class="text-pink-600">sqlite3</span> and
            <span class="text-pink-600">psycopg2 </span>for database programming
            in Python.

          <p class="mt-3">
            Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are sequences of characters
            that define a search pattern. They are used for pattern matching
            within strings, making them a powerful tool for text processing and
            manipulation. Here’s a brief overview of common regular expression

          <p class="mt-3">
            A decorator in Python is a design pattern that allows you to extend
            or modify the behavior of a function without modifying its actual
            code. Decorators are implemented using functions, and they are
            commonly used for tasks such as logging, timing, and authentication.
